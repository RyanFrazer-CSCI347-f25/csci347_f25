# Week 1 Assignment: Secure Password Vault

**Due**: End of Week 1 (see Canvas for exact deadline)  
**Points**: 25 points  
**Submission**: Submit Pull Request URL to Canvas (see submission instructions below)

## 🎯 Assignment Overview

Build a command-line password manager that securely stores website credentials using the cryptographic techniques learned this week. Your implementation should demonstrate proper use of symmetric encryption, password-based key derivation, and secure file handling.

## 📋 Requirements

### Core Functionality (70 points)

Your password vault must implement these features:

#### 1. Master Password Protection (20 points)
- **Secure key derivation** using PBKDF2 with SHA-256
- **Minimum 100,000 iterations** for brute-force protection
- **Random salt generation** (16 bytes minimum)
- **Proper error handling** for incorrect passwords

#### 2. Password Storage Operations (30 points)
- **Add new passwords**: `add_password(website, username, password)`
- **Retrieve passwords**: `get_password(website)`
- **List all websites**: `list_websites()`
- **Update existing passwords**: `update_password(website, new_password)`

#### 3. Secure File Storage (20 points)
- **Encrypted vault file** using Fernet or equivalent
- **Atomic file operations** (write to temp file, then rename)
- **Data integrity verification** on load
- **Graceful handling** of corrupted or missing vault files

### Command-Line Interface (20 points)

Implement a user-friendly CLI with these commands:

```bash
# Create new vault
python password_vault.py init

# Add a password
python password_vault.py add <website> <username> <password>

# Get a password
python password_vault.py get <website>

# List all websites
python password_vault.py list

# Update a password
python password_vault.py update <website> <new_password>
```

### Security Features (10 points)

- **Input validation** to prevent injection attacks
- **Memory cleanup** of sensitive data when possible
- **Secure password generation** option (bonus)
- **Proper error messages** without revealing sensitive information

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Required Libraries
```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
import os
import sys
import json  # or other serialization method
import getpass
import base64
```

### File Structure
```
password_vault.py          # Main implementation
README.txt                 # Usage instructions and design notes
requirements.txt           # Dependencies (if any additional packages)
```

### Data Format
Design your own secure format for storing encrypted password data. Consider:
- How to store multiple passwords in one encrypted file
- How to handle metadata (website names, usernames)
- How to ensure data integrity

## 📝 Detailed Requirements

### 1. Vault Initialization
```python
def init_vault(master_password):
    """
    Create a new password vault
    
    Args:
        master_password (str): User's master password
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if successful, False otherwise
    """
    # Generate salt
    # Derive key from master password
    # Create empty vault structure
    # Save encrypted vault to file
```

### 2. Password Management
```python
def add_password(website, username, password):
    """
    Add a new password entry
    
    Args:
        website (str): Website/service name
        username (str): Username/email
        password (str): Password to store
        
    Returns:
        bool: Success status
    """
    # Load and decrypt vault
    # Add new entry
    # Save encrypted vault
```

### 3. Error Handling
Your program must handle:
- **Incorrect master password**: Clear error message, no stack trace
- **Missing vault file**: Offer to create new vault
- **Corrupted vault file**: Detect and report corruption
- **Duplicate websites**: Either update or error (your choice)
- **Network/disk errors**: Graceful failure messages

### 4. Security Considerations
- **Never store master password**: Only derive keys as needed
- **Clear sensitive variables**: Use `del` or overwrite when possible  
- **Validate input**: Prevent empty passwords, excessively long inputs
- **Use secure temporary files**: For atomic operations

## 💻 Example Usage

```bash
$ python password_vault.py init
Enter master password: [hidden input]
Confirm master password: [hidden input]
✅ Vault created successfully!

$ python password_vault.py add github.com myusername MySecurePass123!
Enter master password: [hidden input]
✅ Password added for github.com

$ python password_vault.py list
Enter master password: [hidden input]
📋 Stored passwords:
   • github.com (myusername)
   • gmail.com (user@email.com)
   • banking.com (account123)

$ python password_vault.py get github.com
Enter master password: [hidden input]
🔑 github.com credentials:
   Username: myusername
   Password: MySecurePass123!

$ python password_vault.py update github.com NewEvenBetterPass456!
Enter master password: [hidden input]
✅ Password updated for github.com
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use additional Python packages?**  
A: Stick to the cryptography library and Python standard library. If you need additional packages, list them in requirements.txt and justify their use in README.txt.

**Q: How should I handle the master password input?**  
A: Use `getpass.getpass()` for hidden password input. Never store the master password in memory longer than necessary.

**Q: What if the vault file gets corrupted?**  
A: Detect corruption (failed decryption, malformed data) and provide a clear error message. Consider implementing a backup/recovery feature for bonus points.

**Q: Should passwords be visible when retrieved?**  
A: Yes, the purpose is to retrieve passwords for use. However, consider security implications and maybe offer a "copy to clipboard" option.

**Q: How complex should the CLI be?**  
A: Focus on functionality over fancy features. A simple, reliable interface is better than a complex, buggy one.
