### Sample Asset Definition
```python
@dataclass
class Asset:
    asset_id: str
    name: str
    asset_type: str  # data, system, facility, personnel
    business_value: int  # 1-5 scale
    confidentiality: int  # 1-5 scale
    integrity: int  # 1-5 scale
    availability: int  # 1-5 scale
    owner: str
    custodian: str
```

### Sample Threat Analysis
```python
def analyze_stride_threats(asset: Asset) -> List[Threat]:
    """
    Analyze asset for STRIDE threats
    Returns prioritized threat list with risk scores
    """
    threats = []
    
    # Analyze each STRIDE category
    for category in StrideCategory:
        threat_scenarios = identify_threat_scenarios(asset, category)
        for scenario in threat_scenarios:
            risk_score = calculate_risk(scenario.likelihood, scenario.impact)
            threats.append(Threat(asset.asset_id, category, scenario, risk_score))
